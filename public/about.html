<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Jamie Kooistra. I'm a 33 year old Web Developer from Australia.</p>

<p>I took an interest in Web Development as future career path in hope for a better work/life balance with more flexibilty. I want to be able to work from home and work remotely while travelling or living abroad.</p>

<p>My hobby is climbing (bouldering) and I also like to play video games and watch Netflix in my spare time.</p>
